Changes for QuantLib 1.9.1:
===========================

QuantLib 1.9.1 is a bug-fix release for QuantLib 1.9.

- Prevented a linking error when multiple compilation units included
  the global ql/quantlib.hpp header (thanks to Dirk Eddelbuettel).

- Prevented a compilation error with gcc 4.4 on RedHat (thanks to
  GitHub user aloupos for the heads-up).

- Prevented a compilation error with the parallel unit runner and the
  recently released Boost 1.63.0.
